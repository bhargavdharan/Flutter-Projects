# Flutter Tutorial

Welcome to the Flutter Tutorial repository! This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up Flutter, creating your first Flutter project, and running it on an emulator or physical device. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a basic understanding of Flutter development and be able to build and run a simple "Hello, World!" app.

## Step 1: Set Up Flutter

To get started with Flutter, follow these steps:

1. Install the Flutter SDK by following the official installation guide: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

2. Set up your development environment. You can choose one of the following options:
   - **Option 1: Android Studio**
     - Download and install Android Studio: [Android Studio Download](https://developer.android.com/studio)
     - Install the Flutter and Dart plugins in Android Studio: [Flutter Plugin Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio)
   - **Option 2: Visual Studio Code**
     - Download and install Visual Studio Code: [Visual Studio Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
     - Install the Flutter and Dart extensions in Visual Studio Code: [Flutter Extension Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode)
   - **Option 3: IntelliJ IDEA**
     - Download and install IntelliJ IDEA: [IntelliJ IDEA Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
     - Install the Flutter and Dart plugins in IntelliJ IDEA: [Flutter Plugin Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio)

3. Verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
    - **flutter doctor**

This command will check your Flutter installation and display a report with any issues or missing dependencies.

## Step 2: Create and Run Your First Flutter Project

Now that you have Flutter set up, let's create and run your first Flutter project. Follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred IDE or text editor (Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, or IntelliJ IDEA).

2. Create a new Flutter project by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
    - **flutter create hello_world**

This command will create a new Flutter project with the name "hello_world" in the current directory.

3. Navigate to the project directory:
    - **cd hello_world**

4. Open the project in your IDE or text editor.

5. Run the project on an emulator or physical device using the following command:
    - **flutter run**


This command will build the project and launch it on your emulator or device.

6. You should see the "Hello, World!" app running on your emulator or device.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and run your first Flutter project.

## Project Idea: Build a Simple "Hello, World!" App

Now that you have your Flutter development environment set up, try building a simple "Hello, World!" app as your first project. Here's a basic outline to get you started:

1. Create a new Flutter project using the steps mentioned above.

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.

3. Navigate to the `lib` directory and open the `main.dart` file.

4. Replace the existing code with the following code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

5. Save the changes and run the project using flutter run command.

6. You should see a basic app with a title bar and the text "Hello, World!" centered on the screen.

Feel free to customize the app further by adding different widgets, styles, or functionalities.

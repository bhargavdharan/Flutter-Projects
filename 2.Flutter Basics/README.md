## Flutter Basics

In this step, you will learn the fundamentals of Flutter, including its architecture, widgets, and widget tree. You will also explore the Flutter widget catalog and understand different types of widgets such as StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget. Additionally, you will learn how to manage layouts using various widgets like Container, Row, Column, Stack, Expanded, and ListView.

### Introduction to Flutter Architecture and Widgets

- Understand the basic architecture of a Flutter app, which follows a widget-based approach.
- Learn about the different types of widgets in Flutter, including StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget.
- Explore the widget tree and understand how widgets are organized and nested in the app's UI.

### Exploring the Flutter Widget Catalog

- Dive into the extensive Flutter widget catalog, which contains a wide range of pre-built widgets.
- Familiarize yourself with common widgets for handling user input, displaying text and images, and managing layouts.
- Learn to choose the right widgets for your app's specific requirements.

### Managing Layouts with Widgets

- Utilize container widgets to control the size, appearance, and positioning of UI elements.
- Arrange widgets horizontally and vertically using Row and Column widgets.
- Overlay widgets using the Stack widget to create complex UI layouts.
- Create flexible layouts using the Expanded widget.
- Display lists of data using the ListView widget.

### Hands-on Exercise: Building a Weather App Layout

Apply your knowledge of Flutter widgets and layouts by creating a basic layout for a weather app. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new Flutter project using the Flutter CLI or your preferred IDE.

2. Open the project in your IDE or text editor.

3. Navigate to the `lib` directory and open the `main.dart` file.

4. Replace the existing code with a new code that represents the layout for the weather app. You can use widgets like Container, Row, Column, and Expanded to structure the layout and display relevant information such as temperature, weather conditions, and a forecast.

5. Customize the layout with appropriate styles, fonts, and colors.

6. Run the app on an emulator or physical device to see the weather app layout in action.

Feel free to experiment and enhance the layout further by adding animations, fetching real-time weather data, or integrating third-party APIs.

## Advanced Flutter Concepts

In this step, you will delve into advanced concepts and techniques in Flutter development. You will learn about state management solutions, navigation and routing, handling user input, working with data persistence, and integrating with external APIs.

### State Management in Flutter

- Understand the importance of state management in Flutter applications.
- Explore different state management solutions such as Provider, Riverpod, BLoC, and Redux.
- Choose the appropriate state management approach based on your app's complexity and requirements.

### Navigation and Routing

- Learn how to navigate between different screens or pages in a Flutter app.
- Implement navigation using the Navigator class and route definitions.
- Handle passing data between screens and managing navigation stacks.

### Handling User Input

- Capture user input using various widgets like TextField, Checkbox, Radio, and DropdownButton.
- Validate user input and provide appropriate feedback or error messages.
- Implement form submission and handle form data.

### Data Persistence

- Learn how to persist data locally in Flutter apps using packages like shared_preferences, Hive, or sqflite.
- Store and retrieve data from databases or local storage.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing app data.

### Integrating with External APIs

- Learn how to fetch data from external APIs and display it in your Flutter app.
- Utilize packages like http or Dio for making HTTP requests.
- Handle asynchronous operations and data loading states.

## Project Idea: Building a To-Do List App

Now that you have a solid understanding of Flutter basics and advanced concepts, let's apply your knowledge to build a simple to-do list app. The app will allow users to create tasks, mark them as completed, and manage their to-do list. Here's a high-level overview of the project:

1. Design the UI for the to-do list app, including screens for creating tasks, displaying the list of tasks, and marking tasks as completed.

2. Implement the necessary widgets and logic to add, update, and delete tasks.

3. Store the tasks persistently using a database or local storage solution.

4. Enhance the app with features such as task filtering, sorting, and reminders.

5. Customize the app's appearance with appropriate themes, animations, and transitions.

This project will provide you with hands-on experience in building a real-world Flutter app with user interactions, data management, and UI design.

Feel free to explore advanced topics such as state management, API integration, and testing to take your to-do list app to the next level.
